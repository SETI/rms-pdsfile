# Deferred observations

Non-blocking items surfaced by per-PR adversarial reviews, recorded for the
phase/PR that owns them.

## From PR-02 (round 1)
- **Freeze is defeatable by editing the manifest/dumper/test.** Inherent to this
  contract style; prohibited by plan §6.4 and documented in both docstrings and
  the allowlist `_comment`. Process control, not a technical gap. Owner: process.
- **`test_api_freeze.py` collection needs holdings env vars** until the root
  `conftest.py` becomes skip-aware. Owner: **PR-09** (already documented in the
  test docstring).
- **`_is_forgiven` lacks `KeyError`/`re.error` guards** for a malformed future
  allowlist entry. Harmless while seeded empty and fail-safe (raises rather than
  mis-forgives). Owner: whichever PR first adds allowlist entries (PR-07/PR-08)
  may add validation.

## From PR-02 (round 2)
- **Module-level public function signatures are frozen by name+kind only.** The
  dumper records signatures for class members but not module-level functions
  (per the PR-02 algorithm, step 3 vs step 4). `cache_lifetime_for_class`
  (public, re-exported into `pdsfile` and `pdsfile.pds3file` from
  `preload_and_cache.py`) could have its signature changed without the freeze
  noticing — a gap vs ground rule 1's "identical signatures." Owner decision:
  leave as spec'd, or extend the dumper to sign module-level functions (small
  additive change; a plan-algorithm deviation needing an addendum per §6.4).
  **RESOLVED (owner, 2026-07-23): leave as spec'd — won't fix.**
  `cache_lifetime_for_class` has no external callers; its only references are
  internal to `PdsFile`. There is therefore no external signature to protect, so
  the freeze's class-member-only signature coverage is sufficient. No dumper
  change; no plan addendum needed.

## From PR-03+04
- **`scripts/dump_public_api.py` trips RUF100 (unused `# noqa: BLE001`).** BLE is
  not in the ruff `select` set, so the noqa is unused. The file is frozen
  post-PR-02 (plan §6.4), so it was ratcheted (`["RUF100"]`) rather than edited.
  A later PR could remove the dead noqa (comment-only, freeze-neutral) with owner
  sign-off, then drop the ratchet entry.

## From PR-07
- **`helper.py` double-import (benign, resolved in PR-08).** After the tests
  move to the top-level `tests/` tree, `helper.py` loads under two module names:
  `pds{3,4}file.helper` (test modules' relative `from .helper`, since `tests/`
  has no `__init__.py` so pytest prepend-mode names the package `pds{3,4}file`)
  and `tests.pds{3,4}file.helper` (root conftest). Harmless — read-only env-var
  constants + stateless functions, no name collision with `pdsfile.pds{3,4}file`.
  PR-08 (conftest moves, tests restructured, `testpaths` added) removes the
  divergence; no action needed before then.

## From PR-08 (round 1–2)
- **`_is_forgiven` ignores a category's `pr` field.**
  `tests/api/test_api_freeze.py::_is_forgiven` never reads `pr`, so §6.1's
  "a category activates only from its named PR" is not enforced in code
  (pre-existing in the PR-02 checker; the file is frozen post-PR-02). The PR-08
  allowlist entry still records `"pr": "PR-08"` for provenance. Owner: a future
  checker-hardening PR with owner sign-off.
- **PR-07's `helper.py` double-import is NOT resolved by PR-08.** The owner's
  split narrowed PR-08 to rule-test extraction only — it did not add
  `testpaths` or restructure `tests/pds{3,4}file/`, which still use `from
  .helper import …`. Re-deferred to whichever PR adds `testpaths` / the
  pds{3,4}file test restructure (the PR-07 note that attributed this to PR-08
  predates the split).

## From PR-06 (CodeRabbit review of #97)
- **17 pre-existing bugs/quality issues in the holdings-maintenance tools** (1
  Critical, 6 Major, 10 Minor) surfaced when PR-06 moved the tools into the
  package. None introduced by the move. Captured in full in
  `critiques/coderabbit-findings.md` — to be addressed in a maintenance-tools
  quality pass (with tests), issue #82, not in a mechanical move PR.
